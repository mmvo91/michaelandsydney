                        Michael known as ``Percy`` in some circles is a quiet man, but so far has been a loving and wonderful boyfriend, fianc√©, and soon-to-be husband. He's introspective and thoughtful when he speaks but often doesn't speak. When alone, he's humorous and the exact opposite of his public persona.

                        She's short and stubborn, but everyone loves her, especially Michael. He's often having to fight off BBG for her attention. But at the end of the day, she always ends up in his arms. She's the perfect balance between motherly and wifely to balance out her man-child man. He appreciates her love and attention and when necessary her scolding.
